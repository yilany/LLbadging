        <h1><b>Learning Lab Badge Base</b></h1>
        <!--this is my intro, and this id will change the font-->
        <p id="intro">The Learning Lab is trying to implement a new badging system to encourage LL Undergraduate Fellows
          <br>and Graduate Fellows to learn and develop new skills! This site is to help you navigate the new system!<br></p>

        <div><p>As you decide to pick up new skills, you'll be able to earn your stripes by accomplishing a set of tasks or by reaching a set of goals for that specific skill.
          The badge, and it's first stripe, will be pinned up on the back wall around your portrait upon completion of the corresponding task.
          The badging system has potential to be fun, convenient, and useful for everyone, but first everyone needs to understand the Badging system.</p></div>
        <p>There are badges available for soft and hard skills. Hard skill badges will be earned through products or deliverables
          while soft skill badges will be based more on personal achievement.</p>
        <p><b>Product/deliverable badge examples:</b>
          <br>1.Creating/editing video on Final Cut Pro
          <br>2.Creating/formatting website with CSS/HTML
          <br>3.Developing a workshop or tutorial
          <br><b>Personal achievement badge examples:</b>
          <br>1.Being interviewed/presenting on camera
          <br>2.Leading a design lab/project
          <br>3.Collaborating well with others<p>
        <div><p>All badges fall into one of 8 different categories. Each category has been assigned a specific color
          with the intent of making it easier to identify what skills people are learning around the Learning Lab.
          Please click on Table of Badges and Classification link below to find more information.</p></div>
